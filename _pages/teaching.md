| Project Title | Students | Year | Domain | Description | Resources |
|---------------|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| E-commerce-Based Construction Material Selling Platform | Md. Yousuf Ali, Dipa Rani Vhoumik, Kaysar Ahmed Shahin, Md. Murshadul Alam Mukta, Abdur Rahman | 2024 | Web Development | A web-based e-commerce platform designed specifically for selling construction materials such as stone, cement, sand, brick, and rod. The system features user authentication with email verification, product categorization, shopping cart functionality, order tracking, payment integration, and administrative capabilities for product and order management. | [🔗 Project Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-PvBtiVOhM2I1YMA2yS240iqpJOTNR_/view?usp=sharing) |
| An E-commerce Based Multi Vendor Web Application | Md. Maksudul Hoque Khan, Md. Hasan, Mehedi Hasan, Habibur Rahman | 2025 | Web Development | A multi-vendor e-commerce platform that allows multiple independent sellers to register, list, and sell their products through a unified marketplace. The system includes separate interfaces for admin, vendors, and customers with features such as product management, order processing, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and payment integration. The platform aims to create a single digital storefront where customers can find diverse products from various vendors while the platform owner manages the infrastructure and earns through commissions. | [🔗 Project Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWkYBXiguL7M4s8W1QB2tQfUH0_nNcSi/view?usp=sharing) |
| HealthXpress: An Innovative Online Platform for Medical Devices and Healthcare Essentials | Md Khalekuzzaman Bakul, Atikul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Humayn Kobir | 2025 | Web Development and AI | An innovative healthcare platform focused on medical devices and essential healthcare products with AI-powered features for enhanced user experience and medical recommendations. | [🔗 Project Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oALhcH_qQ1XtKPtcfzabBNhfnVTqmLH-/view?usp=sharing) |
| SmartHRM: An Intelligent Employee Management System | MD ABDUL MONEM SARKER, MD AL MAMUN, FATEMA BEGUM, TOFAZZAL HOSSAIN, MD SALMAN DEWAN | 2025 | Human Resource Management / AI | An intelligent HRM system that combines modern technologies including biometric facial recognition attendance (using OpenCV, YOLOv8, and FaceNet), predictive analytics for employee churn prediction, and automated workflows. Built with React.js frontend and Django backend, the system includes comprehensive modules for employee profile management, leave tracking, payroll automation, expense management, travel requests, document management, and AI-driven insights. Features contactless face recognition-based attendance, real-time monitoring, role-based access control, and predictive churn analysis using machine learning to enable data-driven HR decisions. | [🔗 Project Book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxz5i3YnnZhYy4X4NTGoYPVP8NjUI8Z2/view?usp=sharing) |

## Ongoing Projects
| Project Title | Students | Year | Domain | Description | Resources |
|---------------|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| BDSafe: Crime and Incident Mapping System for Dhaka Metropolitan Area | - | 2025 | Data Science / Public Safety Analytics | A web-based platform that utilizes Large Language Models to categorize news reports into incident types (violence, theft, road accidents, fraud, etc.) and generates interactive heat maps showing incident frequency and intensity across Dhaka's neighborhoods. The system processes Bengali and English news sources, performs geospatial analysis, and provides searchable area-specific safety insights. Built with Python backend for ML processing, React.js frontend with mapping libraries, and includes temporal analysis features. **Note: Project includes ethical considerations for responsible data presentation and community impact assessment.** | *Project in development* |

## Ongoing Research
| Research Title | Students | Year | Domain | Description | Resources |
|----------------|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Suicidal Trend Analysis Among Bangladeshi Undergraduate Students using Machine Learning | - | 2025 | Machine Learning and Dataset Development | A comprehensive research study analyzing suicidal trends among undergraduate students in Bangladesh using machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to identify risk factors and predictive patterns. | [🔗 Research Paper](#) |
| BDViolence: Context-Aware Violence Recognition in Videos Incorporating Region-Specific Weapon Classification | - | 2025 | Computer Vision / Deep Learning | A novel research project developing a specialized dataset for detecting violence and offensive activities in videos featuring local Bangladeshi weapons (ramda, chapati, hockey stick, etc.). The study employs various deep learning architectures including Vision Language Models, attention transformers, and context retrieval models to improve detection accuracy for region-specific violent behaviors. The research aims to contribute to automated surveillance and security systems adapted for Bangladeshi cultural context through the BDSafe dataset. | *Research in progress* |
