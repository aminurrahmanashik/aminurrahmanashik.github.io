<p align="justify">

I am a Final Year student in the department of <a href="https://cuet.ac.bd/dept/cse/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology</a>. 
I am enthusiastic in NLP research. I have been learning ML and DL about one year and recently got familiarized with NLP and it's relevant fields. My final year thesis is based on product evaluation from e-commerce sites. I always try to be simple but industrious. Problem solving is my entertainment. I really like to think real world problems by mathematics.
