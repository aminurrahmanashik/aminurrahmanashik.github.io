My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Human-Centered AI, with a focus on low-resource languages such as Bengali. As a founding member and active researcher at **KCR-Lab**, I supervise student research projects and lead several initiatives addressing real-world problems in e-commerce, healthcare, and digital discourse analysis.

I am particularly passionate about building benchmark datasets, exploring multilingual transformer architectures, and deploying AI solutions that work effectively in underrepresented regions. My work integrates modern deep learning techniques like BERT, Vision Transformers, and hybrid models in NLP, CV, and beyond.

**Current research themes include:**

* Natural Language Processing for Low-Resource Languages (Bengali sentiment, emoji-aware reviews)
* AI for Social Good (filtering sports comments containing hate/gambling content)
* Deep Learning in E-commerce Feedback Analytics
* Vision Transformers for Healthcare (fundus image classification)
* Dataset development and annotation for applied machine learning
